## Purpose of the project

This is my project 4 for Code Institute as part of their Full stack development diploma. The project is a Full Stack website built using the Django framework.

Little Rascal Recipes is a blog where users can look for a delicious and nutritious meal or snack to prepare for their children aged 12 months and over.

This website initially provides the user with a homepage enticing them to ‘Explore popular Recipes’. Once clicked the page drops down showcasing popular recipes for their child, this is where the user will be prompted to sign up. Once a user signs up and logs in they will have access to a share page where they can view shared and share thier own cookbooks for kids, and have the opportunity to access and partake in the comments section on each recipe.

### MoSCoW

This project used the "MoSCoW" method to classify its features and requirements according to their importance towards a minimum viable product (MVP). "MoSCoW" stands for "Must have, Should have, Could have and Won't have," with each classification aiding in the prioritisation of features. This method makes sure that essential components are tackled in priority order.
