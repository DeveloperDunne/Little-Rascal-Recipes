## Purpose of the project

This is my project 4 for Code Institute as part of their Full stack development diploma. The project is a Full Stack website built using the Django framework.

Little Rascal Recipes is a blog where users can look for a delicious and nutritious meal or snack to prepare for their children aged 12 months and over.

This website initially provides the user with a homepage enticing them to ‘Explore popular Recipes’. Once clicked the page drops down showcasing popular recipes for their child, this is where the user will be prompted to sign up. Once a user signs up and logs in they will have access to a share page where they can view shared and share tier own cookbooks for kids, and have the opportunity to access and partake in the comments section on each recipe.
